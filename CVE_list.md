This can lead to code execution under the context of the library.|
|[CVE-2016-4331](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2016-4331)|||When decoding data out of a dataset encoded with the H5Z_NBIT decoding, the HDF5 1.8.16 library will fail to ensure that the precision is within the bounds of the size leading to arbitrary code execution.|
|[CVE-2016-4330](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2016-4330)|||In the HDF5 1.8.16 library's failure to check if the number of dimensions for an array read from the file is within the bounds of the space allocated for it, a heap-based buffer overflow will occur, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.|
